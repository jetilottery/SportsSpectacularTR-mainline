  <p>
    Each game consists of 6 wheel spins. Press SPIN to spin the wheel. On each
    spin, 3 sections of the wheel spin: an Inner Wheel, Middle Wheel, and Outer
    Wheel. When the wheel stops, all 3 of the highlighted section of the wheel
    are evaluated according to the following:
  </p>
  <p>
    Outer Wheel –3 Ball Symbols of varied types, or Trophy Bonus Symbols are 
    highlighted on the wheel. Each highlighted ball or trophy fills 1 bar on 
    the corresponding  prize meter. Fill all bars on the prize meter to win 
    the prize for that ball. Multiple prizes of different balls may be awarded. 
    Each meter can only be won once. Fill all bars on the Trophy Bonus meter to 
    trigger the Bonus game.
  </p>
  <p>
    Middle Wheel – Awards a 1x, 2x, or 3x ball or trophy multiplier. The multiplier fills 
    the corresponding prize meter for each highlighted ball or trophy on the Outer Wheel 
    by 1, 2, or 3 bars respectively.
  </p>
  <p>Inner Wheel – On each spin, 1 of 3 items are awarded:</p>
  <p>
    • Free Spin Symbol – Adds +1 additional spin to the total remaining spins
    available
  </p>
  <p>
    • Instant Win Symbol – Select 1 of up to 3 Symbols to reveal an instant
    prize
  </p>
  <p>
    • Expand Symbol – Expands the highlighted section of the Outer Wheel,
    increasing the number of balls or trophies highlighted by 2 for a total of 5
  </p>
  <h2 id="BonusGame">Bonus Game</h2>
  <p>
    If all 5 bars on the Trophy Bonus prize meter are filled, the Bonus game plays
    immediately.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Bonus game awards 3 initial spins on a 4x4 grid. Any Trophy Symbol that
    appears on the grid is highlighted and locks into that position on the grid
    for the remainder of the bonus, and the number of spins remaining is reset
    to 3 spins. If no Trophy Symbols appear on the grid, the number of spins
    remaining decreases by 1.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the next spin, any additional Trophy Symbols that appear lock into
    position for the remainder of the bonus, and are added to the total, and the
    number of spins resets to 3.
  </p>
  <p>
    Continue to spin until there are no spins remaining, or all 16 bars on the
    grid are filled with Trophy Symbols.
  </p>
  <p>If 4 or more symbols are revealed, win the corresponding prize.</p>
  <p>
    At the end of the bonus, the game returns to the base game to complete any
    spins remaining on the wheel. Only 1 Bonus game may be awarded.
  </p>
  <p>
    The game ends after all awarded base games spins, and any triggered bonus game 
    has completed. A message appears, indicating the game’s outcome.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dismiss the win message and view the game’s outcome by pressing the message.

  <p>
    Press AUTO SPIN to play the game to completion automatically. Game play
    continues until all selections have been made and any prizes have been
    awarded.

    In this game, the wheel is a graphical animation for entertainment purposes
    only and does not represent an actual wheel. The chances of obtaining a
    specific segment are therefore not equiprobable.
